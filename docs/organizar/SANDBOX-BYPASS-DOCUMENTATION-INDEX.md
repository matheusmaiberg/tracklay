   - `analytics.subscribe()` full spec
   - `browser` API details
   - `init` object structure
   - Network capabilities

3. **Why Bypasses Fail**
   - Why `window.parent` is null (not error)

   - localStorage partition isolation
   - Timing attack ineffectiveness

4. **Working Workarounds**
   - Server-side forwarding architecture

   - Performance optimization

5. **Detection & Troubleshooting**
   - How to detect if tracking works
   - GA4 real-time verification

## Implementation Paths by Use Case

### Path 1: Small Store (< 10K visitors/month)

**Time Investment:** 30 minutes
**Cost:** $0-10/month

```
Custom Pixel
